    <h3>History Of University</h3>
    Turkish Aeronautical Association aimed to become the center of production and training activities of aeronautical practices and went into action to transfer
    the years of intellectual knowledge to the academic basis in order to accomplish this goal.
    A different Turkey, which can produce and export aircrafts as it used to do as well as remaining at the forefront of space research, was imagined and
    thought to be accomplished via a university that meets the increasing demand for qualified manpower and consists of the resources needed to support Research
    and Development. Activities to establish the University of Turkish Aeronautical Association were commenced in 2010. The first step was taken on April 21st,
    2010 and applications were submitted to the appropriate authorities for the establishment of “Aviation Foundation of TAA”.
    A working team was constituted for such activities as following-up the establishment process of the university, formation of academic and administrative
    structures, determining the physical needs, ensuring the communication and coordination and the submission of the documents and information between the
    Aviation Foundation and the Council of Higher Education (YÖK). After conducting researches on other universities specialized in aeronautics in Turkey and
    around the world, a comprehensible feasibility report regarding the establishment of a “University of Aeronautics and Astronautics” was prepared. In line
    with this report, the relevant application about the establishment of the first and only university in Turkey “specialized in aeronautics and astronautics”
    was given to the Higher Education Board on September 3rd, 2010.
    The proposal concerning the establishment of “University of TAA” was negotiated, accepted and enacted by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey on February
    17th, 2011. The relevant law was approved by the President of Turkish Republic and it took effect with the promulgation of the Law No. 6114 in the Official
    Gazette numbered 27863 on March 3rd, 2011.
    Taking up the mission handed down to the whole Turkish nation by our Great Leader Mustafa Kemal Atatürk with the saying “The future is in the sky”, the
    University of Turkish Aeronautical Association, aware of its responsibility as the first university in Turkey “specialized in aeronautics and astronautics”,
    started its first academic year in 2011 with its main campus located in Ankara.
